It helps relieve nerve pain and leg numbness, too.</p>
<p>It has an unbelievably soft cover made with plush Velboa. Though the cover has made with super soft cloth yet it is durable and washable. Considering the little pampering that goes a long way in the 3rd trimester, we pulled out all the stops and found the best material possible.Hiccapop pillow wedge has got the world’s best air ventilation system. To keep pillow cooler they used CertiPUR-US which is free of PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP ("Tris") flame retardants, mercury, lead, heavy metals, formaldehyde, phthalates regulated by the CPSC, and CFCs.</p>
<p>It includes its own travel bag to carry it everywhere. Because of the compact and portable size, you can take it to the bedroom to the couch to your favorite chair for napping. Oversized body pillows are usually bulky and hot. But this convenient size pillow has a very big plus in this case.</p>
